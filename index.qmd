Hi, my name is Garrett Knowlton. I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the [Ecosystem and Landscape Ecology Lab](https://turnerlab.ibio.wisc.edu/). My research interests include landscape ecology, forest ecosystems, disturbances (especially fire), simulation modeling, and climate change adaptation.
