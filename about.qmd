Hi, my name is Garrett Knowlton. I am a PhD student in the Ecosystem and Landscape Ecology Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research focuses on understanding how forest landscapes might change into the future under different climate and disturbance scenarios. My broader interests include climate change adaptation, science policy, and conducting actionable science for land management.
